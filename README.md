# Stop-Watch-using-ATmega32
Developed a Stop Watch system using an ATmega32 microcontroller at 1MHz, Timer1 in CTC mode, and six multiplexed common anode 7-segment displays with a 7447 decoder. Controlled segments using PORTA and PORTC pins. Configured external interrupts to reset, pause, and resume the stopwatch via push buttons.
